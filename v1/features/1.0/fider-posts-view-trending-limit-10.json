It would have been a great foundation to further build out CMS capabilities and probably many other things that we haven't even imagined yet.\n\nBut, the core developers don't need to imagine everything that people will do with our CMS, we just need to provide a solid base for people to build on.\n\nI see this API as mainly an un-opinionated way for plugins like ACF, Toolset, etc to do their job, but much more easily, without having to re-invent almost every piece of the functionality they provide.\n\nFor developers, this would also allow us to easily register all custom post types, fields, etc in the theme or plugin code for a site.  We would change the field definitions in our dev environment, test and deploy, and everything in production is already updated.  We could build a simple UI to manage only the settings that really need to be changed, but this UI wouldn't let users break the custom content types like what happens on sites today.\n\nFor users, it's hard to tell how this would look.  I think this would mostly be a back-end improvement, perhaps with some light UI controls, but most user-facing implementation would be up to plugins until clean standards emerge.","createdAt":"2018-10-03T04:26:39.692857Z","user":{"id":6583,"name":"James Nylen","role":"administrator","avatarURL":"https://petitions.classicpress.net/avatars/gravatar/6583/James%20Nylen","status":"active"},"hasVoted":false,"votesCount":66,"commentsCount":13,"status":"open","tags":["difficulty-hard","request-add-feature"]},{"id":9326,"number":126,"title":"DB structure: each CPT should have their own datatable","slug":"db-structure-each-cpt-should-have-their-own-datatable","description":"As we all now in case of CPTs WP stores all the custom fields in post_meta table, which works of course but is far from being ideal. To show render any custom data for the users WP needs to look through 2 tables or join them. Or if the admin adds later a new custom field to a CPT those land at the end of post_meta table making that whole table a complete mess of randomly mixed data. Even worse if one does not need a custom field in a CPT anymore, well then those data remain in post_meta as orphans.\n\nIMHO instead of all the above each CPT should have its own table in the DB. Everything would be much better organized and more flexible that way (one could add or delete rows anytime to any CPT without leaving garbage in post_meta). Even queries would be faster. I do not see cons at the moment.","createdAt":"2018-12-02T03:39:59.117324Z","user":{"id":10151,"name":"Peter B","role":"visitor","avatarURL":"https://petitions.classicpress.net/avatars/gravatar/10151/Peter%20B","status":"active"},"hasVoted":false,"votesCount":23,"commentsCount":9,"status":"open","tags":[]}]
